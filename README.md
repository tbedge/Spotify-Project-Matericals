# Spotify-Project-Matericals
Python and R Scripts showing how to gather data on individual songs and their 
                  attributes to make playlists based on a desired artist and your mood. Enjoy!

For this project, I began working in python using the Spotipy module to gather the information used to conduct the analysis.
Next I used R to edit the data set as well as group songs into their appropriate moods for the playlists before exporting the list of 20-25
                  unique songs.
Lastly, I went into spotify and manually selected the songs!
Thanks for reading.
